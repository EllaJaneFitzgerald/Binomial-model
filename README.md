# Binomial-model
Implementation of the classical binomial model and its modification for the evaluation of stock options with dividends (written on VBA).

The program consists of the following modules:
1. Positional diagrams,
1. Binomial model of options evaluation,
1. The Black-Scholes model.

## Positional diagrams

The module is designed to create positional diagrams of financial assets such as stocks, bonds, put options, call options, and a portfolio position diagram.

## Binomial model of options evaluation
The module is designed for:
1. Obtaining an evaluation of an option of an arbitrary type for shares with fixed dividends in cash using a binomial model.
2. A visual representation of the work of the method.

## The Black-Scholes model

The module is designed to calculate the value of a European call or put-option without dividends.
